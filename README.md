How It's Made:
Tech used:  JavaScript, React, TailwindCSS, Firebase

I used Firebase for the login and the database, I used ContextAPI for the credentials and functions of the login, and create another context to manage the content of my app and I use Netlify to deploy my app.

Optimizations
Changes to server-side components because I have conflicts with Netlify, netlify makes the render in the server and also optimizes the database it's better to use subcollections.



Lessons Learned:
I learned it's better to use subcollection in Firebase the management of the documents it's more easy.
